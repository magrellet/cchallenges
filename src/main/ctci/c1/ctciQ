1.1 Is unique: Implement an algorithm to define if a string has all unique characters.
    What if if you cannot use additional data structure?
1.2 Check Permutation: Given 2 strings, write a method to decide if one is permutation  of the other
1.3 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume  that the string has sufficient
space at the end to dold the additional characters and that you are given the "true" length of a string


Example:
input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
output:Mr%20John%20Smith
